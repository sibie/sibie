### About Me
I'm Sibie Arunmozhi, a software engineer with a passion for conceptualizing and creating innovative technology solutions. I'm a specialist in designing event-driven, cloud-native microservices using Python & Java tech stacks. While my professional focus is on backend, infrastructure and devops, I also have experience in frontend development and a deep interest in data science which I explore in my spare time.

### My Journey
I graduated in 2016 with an engineering degree in Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong (HKU). During my course, I interned with J.P. Morgan and ended up accepting an offer to join the firm full-time as part of their Technology Analyst Program (TAP) in Singapore. I worked there for 3 years as a full-stack RAD developer in equities and banking technology before returning to India in 2019. Since then, I've spent the past 4 years in the startup scene due to my interest in building fresh products from the ground up. Currently I'm working on Kyro, an AI-powered construction management technology platform that aims to solve two of the biggest problems in the industry - broken workflows and resulting financial issues - with a specific focus on the mission-critical infrastructure sector.
